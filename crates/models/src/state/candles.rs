/// Represents a single price candle in a circular buffer of candles (`CandleBuffer`).
///
/// A candle aggregates trading data over a fixed duration and contains:
///
/// 1. **`open`** - The opening price at the start of the candle. Must be within allowed price limits.
/// 2. **`close`** - The closing price at the end of the candle. Must be within allowed price limits.
/// 3. **`max`** - The maximum price reached during the candle's duration. Must respect price limits.
/// 4. **`min`** - The minimum price reached during the candle's duration. Must respect price limits.
/// 5. **`asset_tokens`** - The total volume of asset tokens traded during this candle.
/// 6. **`crncy_tokens`** - The total volume of currency tokens traded during this candle.
/// 7. **`time`** - The start time of the candle (aligned to the candle duration, i.e., `time % CANDLE.duration == 0`).
/// 8. **`counter`** - Trade counter.
///
/// # Notes
/// - Candles are stored in a circular buffer (`CandleBuffer`).
/// - Prices are represented as integers (`i64`).
/// - The `time` field is always aligned to the candle duration.
/// - Allowed price limits `MIN_PRICE..MAX_PRICE`
